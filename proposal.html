						<h3 class="pt-3">Problem Statement</h3>
						<p>
							Currently, customers have no means of checking allocation on their Metrocards. MTA also fails to provide an equation to the public that allows customers to determine their unique, fair pricing structures for refills.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a solution to these issues, the app aims to provide MTA NY Subway customers a simple way to calculate prices for convenience and fair, purchasing power. The app also aims to fill the gap of a guiding matrix for customers to make decisions based on value per ride or weekly and monthly passes.
						</p>
						<p>
							This takes away a lot of the guesswork and alleviates some of the stressors that come with public transportation. Any subway rider can take advantage of the program, including visitors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some learning curves of the app will include the customer getting accustomed to checking for their ID. The data will also be hypothetical, since MTA doesn’t provide customers with access to details that the unique ID gives access. Users also have to possess some desire to save on the amount they spend on riding the trains.

						<h4>User Stories</h4>
						<p>
							<strong>As a commuter</strong>, I want to update my Metrocard with the exact amount necessary because I’m only working three days this week and I don’t want to overspend.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>As a tourist</strong>, I’m buying swipes for my family of four and we’re all using the same Metrocard. I want to maximize my spending and not have extra money on the card when we leave New York.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>As a businessperson</strong>, I want to use the Metrocard I have from my last business trip, but don’t know how much is on it, or how much I should put on it for my two-day conference. I’m only going to meetings, and back to my hotel. How much should I put on?

				MetroCalc is a tool to check the status of one’s NYC metrocard. In order to test it, our team of 3 usability professionals reached out to residents of NYC that utilizes the subway frequently. The users ranged in age and profession. One common factor was that the tester was a customer to the NYC subways. The users asked to walk through the following 5 tasks:
				<ol>
					<li>
						Check how much value is left on your Metrocard
						<ul>
							<li>
								User must input the Metrocard’s ID number (123)
							</li>
							<li>
								User must submit the info
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Check how much time is left on your Metrocard
						<ul>
							<li>
								User must input the Metrocard’s ID number (000)
							</li>
							<li>
								User must submit the info
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Calculate how much value to add for a specific amount of rides on your Metrocard
						<ul>
							<li>
								User must input the Metrocard’s ID number (123)
							</li>
							<li>
								User must submit the info
							</li>
							<li>
								User should scroll to see their pricing matrix
							</li>
						</ul>				
					</li>
					<li>
						Calculate how much value to add for a specific amount of rides on your Metrocard
						<ul>
							<li>

							<li>
								User adds value to cart
							</li>
							<li>
								User pays and checks out; the time/value is added to their card
							</li>
						</ul>	
					</li>
					<li>
						Check MTA updates on Twitter
						<ul>
							<li>
								User must agree to terms and conditions
							</li>
							<li>
								User opens app to see Twitter feed
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>	
				With the 5 tasks, the users were asked to go through the steps by thinking out loud to reflect the user's’ thinking process as a NYC subway user. The users were given two pre-determined metrocard IDs to mimic the experience of entering the metrocard number in the application.
