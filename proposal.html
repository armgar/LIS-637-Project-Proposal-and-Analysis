			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>
				Currently, customers have no means of checking allocation on their Metrocards. MTA also fails to provide an equation to the public that allows customers to determine their unique, fair pricing structures for refills.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a solution to these issues, the app aims to provide MTA NY Subway customers a simple way to calculate prices for convenience and fair, purchasing power. The app also aims to fill the gap of a guiding matrix for customers to make decisions based on value per ride or weekly and monthly passes.
			</p>
			<p>
				This takes away a lot of the guesswork and alleviates some of the stressors that come with public transportation. Any subway rider can take advantage of the program, including visitors.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some learning curves of the app will include the customer getting accustomed to checking for their ID. The data will also be hypothetical, since MTA doesnâ€™t provide customers with access to details that the unique ID gives access. Users also have to possess some desire to save on the amount they spend on riding the trains.
